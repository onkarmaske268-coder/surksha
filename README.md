# Surksha - Stay Safe, Delete Fake

## Project Overview

**Surksha** is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to detect suspicious WhatsApp APK files using AI/ML technology. The application provides a web-based interface for uploading, scanning, and analyzing APK files to identify potential security threats.

### Problem
Fake WhatsApp APK files pose significant security risks to users, including malware infections, data theft, and privacy breaches. Users often download APK files from untrusted sources, making them vulnerable to malicious applications disguised as legitimate WhatsApp installations.

### Solution
Surksha uses machine learning algorithms to analyze APK files and identify suspicious characteristics that may indicate malicious intent. The tool combines static analysis techniques with AI-powered classification to provide accurate threat detection.

### Objective
Provide users with a reliable, easy-to-use tool to:
- Identify potentially malicious WhatsApp APK files
- Make informed decisions about APK installations
- Safely remove suspicious files from their systems
